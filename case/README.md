Print the case in a light color so that the LEDs show through.

Place the Arduino in the case, and the power jack adapter on the right side of it
inside of the case, and super glue or hot glue it in place. The center hole is for the
pressure sensor, the right hole is for the external power jack (NOT the Arduino's built in)
