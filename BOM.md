The whole assembly (Including Arduino, accessories, etc) will cost you about **$275.0**

If you already have an Arduino, pin headers, etc, you can get this quite a bit cheaper.


The "Electronics Fun Kit" contains many unnecessary parts, but it includes pin headers, and extra
resistors and useful parts. There is also a 10k trimpot you can use (I used this, but had to cut a hole
in the lid because it is too tall.)
